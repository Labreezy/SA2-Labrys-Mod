# The SA2 "Labrys Mod"

## Instructions:

Provide in sets.txt (in the mod's directory) a group of set IDs from a 1024 sheet of your choice, each ID separated by a new line.  You can copy+paste from the leftmost column of the PC 1024 sheet from this google drive folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RW00L3s5yO7mS6Cf8DkzT8poYZKVW4Fl) for ease of use.

When you open the game, you will only get the sets you specify, regardless of which stage you're in.

To reload the sets.txt with the game still open (should you want to change it), press L+R+Dpad Down.  A message in the console should tell you it reloaded the sets and what they were.  Make sure to save your .txt file before reloading!

Happy Hunting!
